3D Audio Simulation and Localization
    This repository contains the implementation of a 3D audio simulation and localization project using Python and MATLAB. 
    The project leverages Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTF) and spatial audio processing techniques to simulate realistic 3D sound effects on standard stereo headphones.
    
Features
    Python GUI: A real-time interactive graphical user interface for sound source localization, enabling users to visualize and manipulate sound positions in 3D space.
    MATLAB Audio Processing: High-quality spatial audio generation using HRTF and interpolation for missing angle data.
    Binaural Audio Simulation: Incorporates ITD (Interaural Time Difference) and ILD (Interaural Level Difference) to enhance sound localization accuracy.
    Applications: Suitable for gaming, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and auditory training systems.

Results
    Real-time 3D sound localization demonstrated via the Python GUI.
    3D spatial sound generated for 360Â° directions using MATLAB.
    ITD and ILD calculations validated against theoretical models.

Future Work
    Improve the audio quality of MATLAB outputs by addressing noise artifacts.
    Expand the application to assistive hearing devices, VR/AR systems, and orchestral audio processing.
    Introduce environmental effects like reverberation for more realistic spatial audio.

Acknowledgments
    Special thanks to our instructors and classmates for their feedback during the demo session, particularly for the suggestion to apply this system to orchestral audio processing.
